# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the document processing system to index and cache processed documents by company code, eliminating the need to reprocess the same company's documents repeatedly. The system will store processed document vectors, metadata, and content in a persistent manner that can be retrieved efficiently for subsequent queries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to index processed documents by company code, so that I can avoid reprocessing the same company's documents multiple times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a company code is provided during document processing THEN the system SHALL store all processed documents with the company code as an index
2. WHEN the same company code is used again THEN the system SHALL retrieve previously processed documents instead of reprocessing URLs
3. WHEN documents are indexed THEN the system SHALL store vector embeddings, metadata, and original content persistently
4. WHEN retrieving indexed documents THEN the system SHALL load them into the vector store for immediate use

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to check if documents exist for a company code, so that I can decide whether to process new documents or use existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking for existing documents THEN the system SHALL return whether documents exist for the given company code
2. WHEN documents exist THEN the system SHALL return metadata about the indexed documents (count, last updated, etc.)
3. WHEN no documents exist THEN the system SHALL return appropriate indicators to proceed with processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to generate responses using indexed documents, so that I can get answers without waiting for document reprocessing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating responses with a company code THEN the system SHALL first check for indexed documents
2. WHEN indexed documents exist THEN the system SHALL use them directly for response generation
3. WHEN no indexed documents exist THEN the system SHALL process URLs and then index the results
4. WHEN using indexed documents THEN response generation SHALL be significantly faster than processing from scratch

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage indexed documents, so that I can update, delete, or refresh company document indexes when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents need updating THEN the system SHALL provide functionality to refresh a company's index
2. WHEN storage needs cleanup THEN the system SHALL provide functionality to delete a company's indexed documents
3. WHEN viewing system status THEN the system SHALL show statistics about indexed companies and document counts
4. WHEN managing indexes THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access safely

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the indexing system to be storage-agnostic, so that it can work with different persistence backends (file system, database, cloud storage).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing indexing THEN the system SHALL use an abstraction layer for storage operations
2. WHEN switching storage backends THEN the system SHALL work without changes to the main logic
3. WHEN storing documents THEN the system SHALL handle serialization and deserialization automatically
4. WHEN accessing storage THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback
